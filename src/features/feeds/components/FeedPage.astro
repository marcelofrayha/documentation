      <p>
        The smart contract ecosystem is constantly evolving. As a result, Data Feeds within the Chainlink ecosystem are
        continuously evaluated for their usage and economic viability across all the blockchains and layer-2 networks
        they are deployed on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data Feeds without publicly known active users may be scheduled for deprecation. Doing so not only helps
        preserve blockchains as public goods by optimizing blockspace usage, but it helps reduce unnecessary costs
        incurred by Chainlink node operators. This process is part of a broader ecosystem shift towards Chainlink
        Economics 2.0, designed to maximize the adoption of the Chainlink protocol while optimizing for cost-efficiency
        and long-term economic sustainability. Over time, new Data Feeds may be launched or relocated to alternative{" "}
        blockchains/layer-2s that better reflect current user demand.
      </p>

  <p>
    Please be careful with the feeds used by your smart contracts. The feeds listed in our official documentation have
    been reviewed; feeds built for custom deployments by other community members might have additional risks. Please do
    close diligence on your feeds before implementing them in your contracts.{" "}
